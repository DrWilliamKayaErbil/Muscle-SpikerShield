# Muscle SpikerShield

You are in control... literally! Now you can control machines and electronics of your Arduino projects with the electrical activity of your muscles! What will you create?

Muscle SpikerShield can be used for numerous experiments. In this repository you will find Arduino code for tree interesting experiments: 
 - Human-Human interface (MuscleSpikerShieldWithHHI_V1_0.ino)
 - EMG controlled robotic Claw (MuscleSpikerShieldWithClaw_V1_0.ino)
 - EMG controlled extension cord (MuscleSpikerShieldWithRelay_V1_0.ino)
