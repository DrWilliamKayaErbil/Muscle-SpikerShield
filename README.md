# Muscle SpikerShield

You are in control... literally! Now you can control machines and electronics of your Arduino projects with the electrical activity of your muscles! What will you create?

[Muscle SpikerShield](https://backyardbrains.com/products/muscleSpikerShield) can be used for numerous experiments. In this repository you will find Arduino code for four example experiments: 
 - [Human-Human interface](https://backyardbrains.com/products/HHI) ([MuscleSpikerShieldWithHHI_V1_0.ino](Arduino Code/HHI/MuscleSpikerShieldWithHHI_V1_0.ino))
 - EMG controlled robotic Claw ([MuscleSpikerShieldWithClaw_V1_0.ino](Arduino Code/claw/MuscleSpikerShieldWithClaw_V1_0.ino))
 - EMG controlled extension cord ([MuscleSpikerShieldWithRelay_V1_0.ino](Arduino Code/relay/MuscleSpikerShieldWithRelay_V1_0.ino))
 - EMG remote control of TENS device ([MuscleSpikerShieldWithRF_V1_2.ino](Arduino Code/RF/MuscleSpikerShieldWithRF_V1_2.ino))
